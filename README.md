### Hi, I'm Beth! 

I am a student web developer at the [University of Central Florida](https://github.com/UCF-Coding-Boot-Camp). I will be graduating in December with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. 

I am also experienced educator, with a focus on exceptional student education. With an awareness that 
there are a multitude of different ways to think and learn, I have jumped into web development with a desire to 
develop projects that will help make the world a little better for all of us. 


### About Me 
⚙️ I am a maker at heart, with a background in design and educaton. I'm a graduate of the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. 

🧠 🧪 🎨 Some of my achievements include working as a STEAM educator to [exceptional education students](https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/district/departments/student-support-services/ese-services/) in Central Florida, virtual teaching for [ExoLab9](https://magnitude.io/exolab-9/) (a collaborative research project between Magnitude.io and the International Space Station), a graphic design internship with Walt Disney Entertainment, and collaborative works with the UCF School of Performing Arts and the UCF School of Visual Arts and Design. 


🤝 I feel most in my element when I am working on a team: communicating ideas, sharing solutions, and turning those BIG ideas into SUCCESSFUL projects. Team work makes the dream work!
