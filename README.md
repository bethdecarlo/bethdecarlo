## Hi, I'm Beth! 

### Welcome to my repository!
I am a student web developer at [UCF Coding Bootcamp](https://github.com/UCF-Coding-Boot-Camp).
Check out my repository to see the projects I am working on! 

### About Me 
I am a maker at heart, with a background in visual arts and theatrical design. I'm a graduate of the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. 
My background in the theatre has lead to refined collaborative skills when it comes to turning BIG ideas into SUCCESSFUL projects. ✨ Team work makes the dream work! ✨


I am also experienced educator, with a focus on exceptional student education. With an awareness that 
there are a multitude of different ways to think and learn, I have jumped into web development with desire to 
develop projects that will help make the world a little better for all of us.
